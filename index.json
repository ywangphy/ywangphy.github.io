Currently, I am working as a postdoc fellow in the physics department and the Institut quantique at Université de Sherbrooke, with Prof. André-Marie Tremblay on the high-temperature superconductors and other quantum materials using both analytical and computational methods for quantum many-body problems.\nDuring my Ph.D. studies, I worked on the theory of gap symmetry and structure in iron-based superconductors with advisor Prof. Peter Hirschfeld at University of Florida. Afterward, I worked as postdoc researcher with Prof. Steve Johnston at University of Tennessee.\nMy current research interests include studying the emergence of quantum phases and competing orders in advanced materials and complex systems using analytical (many-body perturbation theory) and numerical (quantum Monte Carlo, dynamical mean field theory) many-body methods and ab initio (density-functional theory) computational methods. I am especially interested in unconventional or exotic superconducting phases in high-temperature superconductors, in low dimensional or interfacial systems, and in electron-phonon coupled systems.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"598b63dd58b43bce02403646f240cd3c","permalink":"https://ywangphy.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"author","summary":"About me I am a theoretical physicist in the field of condensed matter physics.
